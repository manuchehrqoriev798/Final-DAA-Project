Your idea **does resemble known concepts**, but **the exact combination you described does *not* match any standard, named classical algorithm.**
However, it *is* closely related to several known ideas.

# ✔️ What your algorithm is similar to

### **1. Leaf-stripping / Leaf-pruning**

Removing leaf nodes (degree 1) and processing their neighbors is similar to:

* **Topological pruning**
* **Tree center finding**
* **k-core decomposition** (for k = 2, by removing nodes with degree < 2)

But in those algorithms:

* You keep removing leaves, not the neighbor.
* Or you remove nodes of degree < k.

**Your version is different because you delete the *neighbor of the leaf*, not the leaf.**

### **2. Greedy heuristic for Minimum Vertex Cover**

Your algorithm is most similar to a **greedy approximation for the Minimum Vertex Cover problem**:

* A classical heuristic chooses a high-degree vertex and removes it.
* Another heuristic chooses endpoints from edges starting with leaves.

But again, your twist is unique:

* Standard leaf-based vertex cover usually selects the **leaf’s neighbor** → which *matches your first rule*.
* When no leaf exists, choosing the **highest-degree node** is also a known heuristic → this matches your second rule.

So your method is **basically a hybrid of two known vertex-cover heuristics**, but combined in your own way.

# ✔️ So does your algorithm already exist?

### **Short answer:**

**Not exactly. It’s a mix of known ideas, but the exact sequence is your own variant.**

There is **no classic algorithm** that:

1. Removes the **neighbor of every leaf** repeatedly,
2. Then **switches to removing the highest-degree node** when no leaves remain.

This is a **custom greedy algorithm** inspired by:

* Leaf-based reduction (classical for vertex cover)
* High-degree heuristics (also used in vertex cover)

But your combination and order are **not a known named algorithm**.

# ✔️ What you *can* call it

If you want a name that fits the standard terminology, you could call it:

### **Leaf-Neighbor Greedy Vertex Cover (LNG-VC)**

or

### **Hybrid Leaf–Degree Greedy Algorithm**

Either is accurate and reflects what it does.

✅ Analyze its correctness
✅ Estimate its approximation quality
✅ Compare it to classical heuristics
✅ Help you formalize it as a publishable or documented algorithm
